## 🎨 UI / UX Features

### 1️⃣ Interactive Control Panel
🎛️ Adjust array size, animation speed, and algorithm selection dynamically with sliders and dropdowns.

### 2️⃣ Theme Toggle
🌗 Smooth light/dark mode switch for better visual comfort.

### 3️⃣ Real-Time Step Counter
⏱️ Track steps, comparisons, or recursive calls during execution.

### 4️⃣ Operation Highlights
💡 Color-coded visuals for swaps, comparisons, and path relaxations (e.g., red for comparison, green for success).

### 5️⃣ Split-Screen Algorithm Comparison
⚖️ Run two algorithms side-by-side (e.g., Merge Sort vs Quick Sort).

### 6️⃣ Educational Tooltips
🧠 Hover tooltips explaining what each step of the algorithm does.

### 7️⃣ Animated Transitions
🎬 Smooth dissolve/transition when switching algorithms.

### 8️⃣ Custom Input Mode
🧩 Input custom arrays, graphs, or matrices for personalized test cases.

### 9️⃣ Real-Time Code View
💻 Displays algorithm pseudocode or JS version beside the visualization, highlighting the current line being executed.

### 🔟 Progress Tracker
📊 Shows progress bars or completion percentages during execution.
